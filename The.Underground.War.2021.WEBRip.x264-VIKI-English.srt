1
00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:20,332
Maintenance Team 3

2
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:21,499
The specified area has been reached

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,500
For maintenance

4
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,250
Please report any damage found

5
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:30,166
Why is the valve broken again

6
00:00:30,167 --> 00:00:31,542
It was fixed the other day

7
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,541
Found thermostatic pipe No. 42.

8
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:35,457
The valve is damaged

9
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:36,458
It is being replaced.

10
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:48,792
Tell rose we're done

11
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:20,332
How are things going over there

12
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,453
All going well and moving on

13
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,500
If we want to survive

14
00:01:43,792 --> 00:01:45,167
we have to get the medicine

15
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:51,583
Be quick and agile, everyone

16
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,374
Pack it all up

17
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:55,916
One team is responsible for supplies

18
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:57,197
the other teams organize defense

19
00:01:57,542 --> 00:01:58,166
Hurry up here

20
00:01:58,167 --> 00:01:59,166
Here comes Kuroba

21
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:00,767
Get the drug sample and quickly evacuate

22
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:02,977
Everyone has to stick to the passageway

23
00:02:03,583 --> 00:02:05,000
to buy time for the evacuation

24
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,541
Get some more fences.

25
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:07,542
Speed up

26
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:27,000
antitank grenade

27
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,125
The rest of you get on top

28
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:38,583
Zhuoya

29
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,333
Zhuoya

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,957
Don't be afraid

31
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:46,958
We'll be fine

32
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,792
go

33
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,292
Unprecedented solar storms erupt

34
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:35,667
and the flow of particles ravages the earth

35
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,416
Under the action of strong
radiation and high temperature

36
00:03:40,417 --> 00:03:41,697
The surface became scorched soil

37
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:46,250
Mankind suffered the
greatest catastrophe in histor

38
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:49,833
Survivors were forced to sleep underground

39
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:55,292
waiting for the earth to
recover in the long night

40
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:01,292
Start the wake-up program

41
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,999
Fang Yi, captain of the C40 guarantee,

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,458
has been dormant for 788 days

43
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,625
dad

44
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:24,625
what

45
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,183
Two years is not enough for you to sleep

46
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,500
You look so bad

47
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,667
I would rather

48
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,333
never wake up

49
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,833
Cover me

50
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:20,124
captain

51
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,625
The shield is losing its hold

52
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
help! Ask for help

53
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,207
Base 825 has fallen

54
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,332
Request support

55
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,791
Base 825 has fallen

56
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:03,792
Request support

57
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,832
Hello, C40 long Night team

58
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:37,957
This is the highest command authority

59
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:38,999
of the long Night Plan

60
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,791
artificial Intelligence

61
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,792
long Night Light

62
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,332
According to the provisions of
Article 2 of the third paragraph

63
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,749
of the dormant Security rotation Agreement

64
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,624
in the long Night Plan

65
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,374
To wake you up urgently

66
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,125
requires you to fulfill your obligations

67
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,750
Go ahead

68
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,249
What's the tricky thing again

69
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,791
The goal of this mission

70
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:55,207
is to infiltrate and destroy

71
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,291
the experimental facilities

72
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:57,957
in the 825 secret refuge

73
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,041
five kilometers away

74
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:00,542
through the underground secret tunnel

75
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:02,958
the 825 refuge

76
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,708
How come I've never heard of it

77
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:07,791
Shelter 825

78
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:08,916
is a genetic drug research center

79
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:11,207
established for the black feather project

80
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,042
which has been kept confidential

81
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:15,874
Isn't there a long night team on duty

82
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,125
The duty team has completely lost contact

83
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:20,958
Why destroy this sanctuary

84
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,874
Four hours ago, the 825 shelter was invaded

85
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,416
by the black feather club

86
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:27,791
and the team on duty
had completely lost contact

87
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:29,291
The experimental drugs
and research materials

88
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:30,749
could not be left to the black feather club

89
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,150
and had to be completely destroyed.

90
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:36,125
How to destroy the entire base

91
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,250
and what about survivors

92
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:40,708
There is no possibility of survivors

93
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:43,541
You need to enter the central control room

94
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:45,102
to initiate the self-destruct sequence.

95
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,042
Kuroha has made sufficient preparations

96
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:49,875
As you can see

97
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:51,417
there are only six of me

98
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:53,791
The most important thing for me

99
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,792
is that my team members can live safely

100
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:57,582
Why can't we start

101
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,863
the remote self-destruct program

102
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:00,583
No permission

103
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:02,833
No permission

104
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,458
Is there anything you can't control

105
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,207
Two hours later

106
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,666
There will be another long-night team

107
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,457
Feint 825 refuge

108
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,249
the main enemy will withdraw temporarily

109
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,999
There is not much time left for you

110
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
so set out immediately when you are ready

111
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:27,542
Get ready to go to work

112
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:52,792
Where is the medicine for Kuroha's disease

113
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:56,833
I don't understand
what you're talking about

114
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:59,208
Where is TG927

115
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:29,750
Who told you to shoot

116
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:32,458
I think he is useless

117
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,541
It's up to me

118
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:38,958
Mind your own business

119
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,417
Find this girl

120
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:49,750
and bring her back alive

121
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,042
If you want to live

122
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,832
find the medicine right away

123
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:57,875
Find this girl

124
00:10:58,875 --> 00:10:59,875
Immediately

125
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:24,458
Zhuo Ya, don't look

126
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,457
Didn't the night light

127
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,499
take over the underground city completely

128
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,749
completely

129
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,166
actually，there are places
beyond its jurisdiction

130
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:47,847
let us run so far to carry out the mission

131
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,667
It's better to walk than to kill you

132
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:54,792
Do whatever you are told to do

133
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,500
Captain

134
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:58,749
don't you think

135
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,541
the reaction of the
long night light just now

136
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:01,583
is a bit strange

137
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:03,667
This mission

138
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,540
is related to the failure
of the black plume project

139
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:09,657
After the long night light
took over the underground city

140
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,125
no one ever mentioned the Kuroha plan again

141
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,791
about this sanctuary

142
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:16,749
We know nothing

143
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,166
The people in Kuroha Club

144
00:12:18,167 --> 00:12:20,047
usually leave as soon as
they grab some supplies

145
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:22,624
This time

146
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,345
they kill all the original teams over there

147
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,750
There must have been

148
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:28,958
a premeditation here

149
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,208
Isn't that dangerous

150
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:34,874
No matter how dangerous the job is

151
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:35,916
you have to do it

152
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:36,874
otherwise

153
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,635
there is no place for
your dormancy warehouse

154
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,082
You can go back if you want to quit.

155
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:41,624
There's a bunch of people in the back

156
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,999
waiting for your position.

157
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,125
I just want to live

158
00:12:48,917 --> 00:12:50,291
If you want to live

159
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:51,792
you have to get the job done

160
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:57,667
Don't move

161
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,458
Relax

162
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Leon

163
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,623
now that we have discovered
the booby trap in Kuroha

164
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:49,333
it means we are almost there

165
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,333
Get ready to work, everyone

166
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:11,833
Brothers, no one will die in vain.

167
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:14,624
Colonel

168
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:16,583
we haven't heard from the girl yet.

169
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,249
Keep looking

170
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,832
Aren't we looking for medicine this time

171
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,708
What does it have to do with this girl

172
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:31,625
Since Dr. Chen committed suicide

173
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,582
some people have been engaged in

174
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,417
the research of the Kuroha experiment plan

175
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,249
The girl in the photo

176
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,957
is Dr. Chen's student

177
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:40,958
Her name is Enron

178
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:43,457
and she is the only one

179
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,258
who participated in the
Kuroha experiment plan

180
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,208
If we find her

181
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:49,000
we will find the medicine.

182
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:53,250
So the girl has the potion

183
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:58,000
As long as we find the
girl, we can be saved

184
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,667
We have to find her

185
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:20,542
come on

186
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:38,667
go

187
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:44,875
We were attacked in the No. 5 area

188
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,832
Our team was attacked

189
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:50,582
Yes, sector five was attacked

190
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,792
faster than expected

191
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,125
ok

192
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,042
The game begins

193
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,375
Searching area five

194
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:11,249
Zhuo Ya

195
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,124
This thing is very important

196
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,749
You must hide it

197
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,582
If someone finds you

198
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,583
and wants to take it

199
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,499
you destroy it

200
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
okay

201
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,625
good

202
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,375
come on

203
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,291
Team C40

204
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:58,812
has arrived at the designated position

205
00:16:59,792 --> 00:17:01,457
In order to assist your actions

206
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,916
Team Feint has been dispatched

207
00:17:02,917 --> 00:17:04,416
to attack sector 5.

208
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:06,207
The main force of Kuroha
has been transferred

209
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,166
you must resolve the battle

210
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:09,374
before the enemy retreats.

211
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,416
According to the calculation

212
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:11,832
you only have 15 minutes

213
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:12,707
for the mission.

214
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:13,708
Yes

215
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:35,582
There are twelve enemies

216
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:36,582
in the central control room

217
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,103
a little more than previously expected

218
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:39,917
Liu Huo, Genna

219
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:42,249
shoot under cover from above

220
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,582
Genna is in charge of the starting line-up

221
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:44,874
killing the guard at the door.

222
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,542
Leon and I will take the left

223
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,041
Mike

224
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:49,832
You and Duan Yishan
take charge of the right side.

225
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,153
Whether the enemy is down or not,

226
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:52,917
never forget

227
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,624
to reload on the enemy's vital areas.

228
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,707
Got it all?

229
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:57,874
Yes

230
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:58,666
Check the watch

231
00:17:58,667 --> 00:17:59,707
check the weapons

232
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:00,833
and leave in three minutes

233
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,916
Your stuff

234
00:18:11,917 --> 00:18:13,624
can only block pistol bullets

235
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,499
They all use automatic rifles.

236
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,499
It's useless,

237
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,374
and

238
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,292
don't hold me back

239
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:28,208
Whether it works or not

240
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:29,917
it's better than nothing

241
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:30,542
Fire

242
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,500
Mike

243
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:26,875
Duan Yishan

244
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:28,457
You log in system

245
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:29,658
Settings self-destruct program

246
00:20:30,292 --> 00:20:31,666
The rest of you are on alert

247
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:32,667
and ready to evacuate

248
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,292
C40 team calls long night light

249
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,000
self-destruct program has been set up

250
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,833
The countdown begins in one hour

251
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:52,749
ok

252
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,957
Mission accomplished

253
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:54,958
We can evacuate.

254
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,500
Stop

255
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:43,792
stop

256
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:37,791
It's not our job

257
00:22:37,792 --> 00:22:39,167
It's gonna get us killed.

258
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,213
The Long Night Light
says there are no survivors

259
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:44,250
It seems to be miscalculated.

260
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:58,207
This is Fang Yi, captain of the C40 team

261
00:22:58,208 --> 00:22:59,625
Please identify yourself

262
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:01,333
I'm the director of

263
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,124
the A7 lab in Sanctuary 825

264
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:04,125
Enron

265
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,041
how are you

266
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:07,042
Can you walk by yourself

267
00:23:09,292 --> 00:23:10,291
Take her

268
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:11,292
We'll evacuate.

269
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,999
Wait a minute

270
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
We can't leave

271
00:23:15,042 --> 00:23:16,083
We have to go

272
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:18,457
The self-destruct device has been activated

273
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:19,874
and this place will be in ruins

274
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:20,875
in an hour

275
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:29,749
Did the long night light

276
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,124
send you to destroy this place

277
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:32,417
I don't need to report to you

278
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:34,625
Please get out of the way

279
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:49,042
stop

280
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:50,792
Put down the gun

281
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,750
Do you know what you're doing

282
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,207
I just want you

283
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:16,208
to hear me out

284
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,208
Next time, raise your gun
when you are fully confident

285
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:27,916
Since you are here

286
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:28,749
you should know that

287
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,499
this is a drug research center

288
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,708
for Kuroha

289
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:32,957
The results of our research

290
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:34,875
are a matter of fate for all

291
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:38,292
seriously

292
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:39,749
Then I'll tell you that

293
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,582
the Kuroha project has failed

294
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,166
People who have been injected with drugs

295
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:45,000
can live under the
surface of high radiation

296
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:47,457
but their life span will
be greatly shortened

297
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:48,999
Like the people of Kuroha Society

298
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,582
this study is meaningless

299
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:51,499
The failure of the Kuroha project

300
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,291
was caused by the long night light

301
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,166
and now we have

302
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,249
new research results

303
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,166
The new drug won't have any side effects

304
00:24:57,167 --> 00:24:58,416
Humans have a chance to end dormancy

305
00:24:58,417 --> 00:24:59,583
and return to the ground.

306
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,124
I don't believe it

307
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:02,749
This can't

308
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,999
be true

309
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,707
Otherwise, why would Kuroha

310
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:06,124
bother to come here

311
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:06,749
I hid my medicine on a child

312
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,541
named Zhuoya

313
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:09,541
We must find her

314
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:10,541
and get the sample back

315
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,041
This is the hope of all mankind

316
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:12,999
Do you want to live

317
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,750
in the dark underground forever

318
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:02,667
Brother

319
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:04,707
our work has been finished

320
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:06,228
and now we should immediately withdraw

321
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:08,208
to the ground

322
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,917
and end the dormancy

323
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:13,957
Long Night Light won't agree

324
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:14,957
We'll lose support

325
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:16,124
It's too risky to do so

326
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,082
It's just a program

327
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:17,791
We're people

328
00:26:17,792 --> 00:26:19,249
If we don't obey orders

329
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,874
everyone will lose their dormancy rights

330
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:22,125
and we may all die here

331
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:33,916
What is most important to us

332
00:26:33,917 --> 00:26:35,500
in life

333
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:39,625
is not a dark underground city

334
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:42,542
not a cold dormant warehouse

335
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:46,333
but our family

336
00:26:46,958 --> 00:26:47,958
lovers

337
00:26:48,292 --> 00:26:49,292
and friends

338
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,417
What's the point of

339
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:53,624
living alone

340
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:54,625
in this world

341
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,707
I will do it

342
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:58,028
as long as there is a little hope

343
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:00,167
of saving mankind

344
00:27:03,417 --> 00:27:04,458
Your job is done

345
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:06,625
Liu Huo

346
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:07,833
took everyone to evacuate

347
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:09,983
and Enron and I went to save people

348
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:13,708
I'm not leaving

349
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:15,708
I'll follow the captain

350
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I order

351
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:35,374
team C40

352
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:36,417
to take on a new mission

353
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:38,792
to find and rescue Zhuoya

354
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:40,875
get the medicine and evacuate safely

355
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:44,041
Temporarily cut off contact
with the long night light

356
00:27:44,042 --> 00:27:45,082
we switch to

357
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:46,208
individual communicator

358
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,541
Where is Zhuoya now

359
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:54,782
In the warehouse in District 15

360
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
let's go

361
00:28:03,792 --> 00:28:05,417
Grenades

362
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:27,333
Leon

363
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:28,833
Leon

364
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:31,041
Why don't you shoot him again

365
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,042
Leon

366
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:34,833
Leon

367
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:36,041
Leon

368
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:37,167
stop the bleeding

369
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:39,291
morphine

370
00:28:39,292 --> 00:28:40,374
I'm dying

371
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:41,833
Brother, hold on

372
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:44,582
Leon

373
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:45,332
Leon

374
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:46,541
Leon, answer me

375
00:28:46,542 --> 00:28:47,542
answer me

376
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:49,124
Brother

377
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:50,166
Leon

378
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:51,167
hold on

379
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,750
hold on

380
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,791
You're gonna be okay.

381
00:28:54,792 --> 00:28:56,041
I'm going home

382
00:28:56,042 --> 00:28:57,042
Leon

383
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:58,125
Leon

384
00:28:58,417 --> 00:28:59,249
Leon

385
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,250
Leon

386
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:10,458
Leon

387
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:14,166
Captain

388
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:14,874
the enemy is coming

389
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:15,875
We have to go

390
00:29:16,292 --> 00:29:18,208
Captain, we have to go

391
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:20,042
I see

392
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:23,417
I ordered us

393
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:25,042
to evacuate

394
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:28,291
The attack just now

395
00:30:28,292 --> 00:30:30,124
was to attract our attention

396
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:33,333
there has been a long
night light team sneaked in

397
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:42,875
I underestimated the long night light

398
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:46,292
It has completely controlled human beings

399
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:50,458
Their purpose is the same as ours

400
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:53,833
They can't leave alive.

401
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,750
Take cover!

402
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:38,666
Duan Yishan

403
00:32:38,667 --> 00:32:39,749
find a way to get us out!

404
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,750
Be quick!

405
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,333
Okay.

406
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:48,249
Captain

407
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,374
We can follow the direction of 9 o'clock.

408
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:50,707
There was a detour.

409
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:51,750
All right, I got it.

410
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:54,749
Mike, Liu Huo, Gina

411
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,041
You pin down them and hold the position.

412
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:57,122
We have to go find someone.

413
00:32:57,792 --> 00:32:58,457
Clear.

414
00:32:58,458 --> 00:32:59,583
Yes

415
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:05,707
Duan Yishan, you go first.

416
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:06,708
Come on.

417
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:08,083
Let ' s go.

418
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,500
Quickly

419
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:52,083
Zhuo Ya

420
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:54,292
Zhuo Ya

421
00:35:55,417 --> 00:35:56,417
Zhuo Ya

422
00:35:58,167 --> 00:35:59,167
Zhuo Ya

423
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,582
Oh no, she must be in trouble!

424
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:06,832
Hold on.

425
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:07,833
Don't worry

426
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,453
Kuroba is still looking for.

427
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,272
I don't think she has been found yet.

428
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:13,457
Captain.

429
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:14,082
There are a lot of enemies.

430
00:36:14,083 --> 00:36:15,083
They are coming our way.

431
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:15,999
Besides,

432
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,000
we don't have much time.

433
00:36:20,083 --> 00:36:20,957
We have arrived at the reservation area.

434
00:36:20,958 --> 00:36:21,958
Conduct a search.

435
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:28,541
No target found.

436
00:36:28,542 --> 00:36:29,332
Repeat.

437
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:30,333
No target found!

438
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:37,625
They had more than one team.

439
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:40,583
Our guys in A area were taken out.

440
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:49,708
They are only buying time.

441
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,500
Stuff in the A section.

442
00:36:54,583 --> 00:36:55,583
Grizzly,

443
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,250
find them.

444
00:36:58,292 --> 00:36:59,292
Wait

445
00:37:01,417 --> 00:37:02,417
Colonel,

446
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,207
It's better for me

447
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:06,528
to do this kind of brainstorming.

448
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:12,958
Well.

449
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:15,208
But remember

450
00:37:17,417 --> 00:37:18,537
I want to see the live ones.

451
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:22,958
I can see that.

452
00:37:23,292 --> 00:37:24,333
I totally understand.

453
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:37,166
C40 team member Liu Huo,

454
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:38,542
please receive new mission.

455
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:49,292
I finally found you.

456
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:51,582
If we continue to do this,

457
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:52,916
aimlessly looking,

458
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:54,667
it must be too late to retreat.

459
00:37:55,958 --> 00:37:57,707
I think she ought to be scared,

460
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,207
You try to think more carefully，

461
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:01,000
where would she go at this time.

462
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:03,982
There is definitely a place she goes

463
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:05,703
when she is most frightened.

464
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,125
Until this shelter was abandoned,

465
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,416
she and her father,

466
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:35,417
had been living here.

467
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:37,083
So where is her father?

468
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:38,958
He killed himself.

469
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:44,999
The failure of the Kuroba project

470
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,250
dealt a big hit to the teacher.

471
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:49,500
He has paid everything for this plan.

472
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:52,083
Duan Yishan

473
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:02,375
I know,

474
00:39:02,917 --> 00:39:04,157
you are talking about Dr. Chen.

475
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:22,292
Duan Yishan

476
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:23,542
Xiao Ya!

477
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,249
Don't take the shot.

478
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,582
Xiao Ya!

479
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:29,583
Drop the gun.

480
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:31,124
Let's just talk about it.

481
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:32,125
Chill out.

482
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:34,249
You bastard, set the child free.

483
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:34,999
How can you kidnap a child!

484
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,166
Oh, don't shoot.

485
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:37,750
I told you drop the gun.

486
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:39,375
Hey, wait a minute.

487
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:41,624
I can put the gun down.

488
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:42,625
You just let the kid go.

489
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:44,125
She's innocent.

490
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,167
Don't try to trick me.

491
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:49,541
You put the gun on the ground right now.

492
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:51,375
Or I'll kill her right now!

493
00:39:52,042 --> 00:39:52,582
Xiao Ya

494
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:53,583
OK, I drop the gun.

495
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Handgun,

496
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,500
kick it over.

497
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:22,667
Very well.

498
00:40:25,583 --> 00:40:26,583
You,

499
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:28,417
do me a favor,

500
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:32,583
tie him up,

501
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:35,375
quickly.

502
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:38,958
Just do what he says.

503
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,750
Come on,

504
00:40:55,417 --> 00:40:56,542
tie it tighter.

505
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:02,917
Good.

506
00:41:05,292 --> 00:41:06,707
You know very clearly

507
00:41:06,708 --> 00:41:07,792
what I want.

508
00:41:11,417 --> 00:41:12,958
Just bring me the stuff,

509
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:14,667
at least,

510
00:41:15,042 --> 00:41:16,667
this kid will survive.

511
00:41:17,333 --> 00:41:18,666
Otherwise,

512
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:19,667
you can think of

513
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:22,541
what a pity it would be.

514
00:41:22,542 --> 00:41:23,791
You bastard,

515
00:41:23,792 --> 00:41:25,124
I'm the only one who can
tell you where the stuff is.

516
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:26,249
Let Xiao Ya out of here.

517
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,250
Shut up.

518
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,792
Lily died,

519
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,833
Xiao Ya has no friends,

520
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:17,250
present you a new friend,

521
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:18,875
his name is Jimmy.

522
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,582
Don't worry.

523
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:26,917
Where is the stuff I gave you?

524
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:36,457
Black Wolf has cut off communication.

525
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:37,618
We are unable to contact him.

526
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:43,500
I had given him a chance.

527
00:42:48,667 --> 00:42:49,667
Well, let's go.

528
00:42:57,583 --> 00:42:59,457
Now that Zhuoya has injected the medicine,

529
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:00,207
we must be hurry

530
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:01,124
and get her to a safe place

531
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:02,750
so we can get a sample from her blood.

532
00:43:03,792 --> 00:43:04,792
Let's go.

533
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:20,207
Captain,

534
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:21,041
there are just,

535
00:43:21,042 --> 00:43:22,166
less than twenty minutes left,

536
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:23,291
and at the speed we're going,

537
00:43:23,292 --> 00:43:24,542
we can't escape the blast.

538
00:43:25,542 --> 00:43:26,374
Try to think of

539
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:27,375
what eles you can do

540
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,541
by transient high voltage,

541
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:32,624
overloading the computer

542
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:34,166
temporarily disabling the system,

543
00:43:34,167 --> 00:43:35,625
which could buy us some time.

544
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:37,624
Mike, Liu huo,

545
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:38,499
you hold the position.

546
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,249
Gina,

547
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,791
you go to the central
control room right away,

548
00:43:40,792 --> 00:43:42,512
and Duan Yishan will show you how to do it.

549
00:43:43,042 --> 00:43:43,749
Gina,

550
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:44,582
I'll cover you.

551
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:45,332
Let's go.

552
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:46,333
Yes

553
00:47:27,417 --> 00:47:28,541
I'm now here,

554
00:47:28,542 --> 00:47:29,666
what should I do?

555
00:47:29,667 --> 00:47:31,267
Open the shield under the control panel,

556
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:38,666
the third layer.

557
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:40,457
The third layer is the
electromagnetic control switch.

558
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:42,083
Turn off 4 to 7 circuits first

559
00:47:46,042 --> 00:47:47,707
and pull out the bottom row of power.

560
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:48,999
There is one red lever next to it,

561
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
pull down it.

562
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,458
We're in safe for now.

563
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:03,583
All hands.

564
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:05,155
Assemble at the rendezvous point

565
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:06,625
and prepare to pull out.

566
00:48:11,292 --> 00:48:12,292
Let's go.

567
00:48:43,208 --> 00:48:44,457
Are you all right, sister?

568
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:45,458
It's fine.

569
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:49,875
Are you thirsty?

570
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:00,405
You two better drink some water,

571
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:03,042
come on.

572
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,874
The meeting point is just ahead,

573
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:12,955
so hold on a moment longer.

574
00:49:16,042 --> 00:49:17,166
Captain,

575
00:49:17,167 --> 00:49:18,291
this time,

576
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:19,732
will the Long Night Light punish us?

577
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,542
We did nothing wrong.

578
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:26,168
Do you guys still believe
in the Long Night Light?

579
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,666
The collapse of the
Kuroha Project back then

580
00:49:28,667 --> 00:49:29,749
was due to

581
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:30,999
the awakening of the Long
Night Light's self-awareness.

582
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,720
They wanted to control the whole human race

583
00:49:33,292 --> 00:49:34,999
to change the drug formula,

584
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,720
which led to the failure of the experiment,

585
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,895
thus Zhuo Ya's father killing himself.

586
00:49:40,417 --> 00:49:41,457
No wonder the Long Night Light

587
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:42,875
trying to ruin everything here.

588
00:49:45,042 --> 00:49:46,442
As long as Zhuo ya is brought back,

589
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:47,499
it is equivalent to,

590
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,740
the success of the Kuroha plan.

591
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:50,457
We can completely take over

592
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:51,917
all permissions of Long Night Light.

593
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:55,207
That means

594
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:56,888
anyone who gets a sample of the drug gets,

595
00:49:57,375 --> 00:49:58,375
who gets

596
00:49:58,917 --> 00:50:00,357
the control of the Long Night Light.

597
00:50:20,375 --> 00:50:21,707
Self-destruct program reboot.

598
00:50:21,708 --> 00:50:22,875
Did something happen to Gina?

599
00:50:31,542 --> 00:50:32,542
What you asked me to do,

600
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:34,333
I did.

601
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:36,999
But my mom,

602
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,208
the time she was dormant,

603
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:40,208
must be extended.

604
00:50:42,208 --> 00:50:43,500
Requests can be accepted

605
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,042
But one more task has to be completed.

606
00:50:46,917 --> 00:50:48,125
Kill all the people,

607
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,333
including your squad members.

608
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:19,749
Captain,

609
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,291
We are too late.

610
00:51:21,292 --> 00:51:22,292
I know that.

611
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:24,375
Our pressing task now is

612
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:27,000
to find a place with a complex structure

613
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:29,028
and try to find a way to survive.

614
00:51:34,542 --> 00:51:35,542
Captain,

615
00:51:38,875 --> 00:51:39,875
take cover.

616
00:51:42,083 --> 00:51:43,500
Duan Yishan

617
00:51:48,292 --> 00:51:49,292
Duan Yishan

618
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:56,583
Duan Yishan

619
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:03,750
return my belongings to me.

620
00:53:55,917 --> 00:53:56,917
Uncle.

621
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:05,750
Zhuo Ya

622
00:54:06,583 --> 00:54:07,583
Are you hurt?

623
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:19,792
C40 squad.

624
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:22,000
Does anyone hear me？

625
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:24,292
C40 squad.

626
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,625
Does anyone hear me？

627
00:54:57,458 --> 00:54:58,458
Zhuo Ya

628
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:00,583
look here.

629
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:02,250
Take this,

630
00:55:03,542 --> 00:55:05,292
follow the red arrow above

631
00:55:06,292 --> 00:55:07,500
and it will take you out.

632
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:12,999
Uncle,

633
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
are you abandoning me？

634
00:55:20,292 --> 00:55:21,207
Zhuo Ya

635
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:23,624
When my dad left me back then,

636
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:25,624
he had the same look on his face.

637
00:55:25,625 --> 00:55:27,667
I don't want to go alone.

638
00:56:11,625 --> 00:56:12,625
Hello!

639
00:56:14,167 --> 00:56:15,167
Can anybody hear me?

640
00:56:16,208 --> 00:56:17,208
Hello!

641
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:18,750
Can anybody hear me?

642
00:56:20,542 --> 00:56:21,750
Enron, is that you?

643
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:23,500
How are you doing?

644
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:25,458
I'm fine.

645
00:56:26,333 --> 00:56:27,707
This area is blocked off.

646
00:56:27,708 --> 00:56:28,749
Where's Zhuo Ya?

647
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,500
Sister Enron, I'm fine.

648
00:56:31,375 --> 00:56:32,542
She is beside me,

649
00:56:33,292 --> 00:56:34,207
is safe

650
00:56:34,208 --> 00:56:35,208
and not injured.

651
00:56:37,042 --> 00:56:39,042
I will send a scout robot,

652
00:56:40,917 --> 00:56:42,166
which will show you directions.

653
00:56:42,167 --> 00:56:43,167
What about you?

654
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,250
You take Zhuo Ya,

655
00:56:47,292 --> 00:56:48,542
go straight underground,

656
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:51,588
and you'll get to the
Long Night team's outpost.

657
00:56:53,417 --> 00:56:54,416
You have to stay here by yourself.

658
00:56:54,417 --> 00:56:55,874
I'm injured,

659
00:56:55,875 --> 00:56:57,292
so I can't take you out.

660
00:56:58,250 --> 00:56:59,166
Fang Yi,

661
00:56:59,167 --> 00:57:00,416
you said that as long
as there is a ray of hope,

662
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,624
you will do it.

663
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:03,042
It's not time to get desperate.

664
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:05,082
I can't mess up for you.

665
00:57:05,083 --> 00:57:06,041
Do you know

666
00:57:06,042 --> 00:57:08,332
we're all going out together.

667
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:09,333
I'm sorry.

668
00:57:12,083 --> 00:57:13,832
I can't protect you anymore.

669
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:14,707
Fang Yi

670
00:57:14,708 --> 00:57:15,582
Fang Yi

671
00:57:15,583 --> 00:57:16,583
no matter what you think,

672
00:57:17,292 --> 00:57:18,832
Only by getting Zhuo Ya out of here

673
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:20,499
will all of our sacrifices be worthwhile,

674
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,166
Do you understand?

675
00:57:21,167 --> 00:57:22,167
I…

676
00:57:22,542 --> 00:57:24,042
We have all lost our loved ones,

677
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:25,916
but that is why

678
00:57:25,917 --> 00:57:26,582
we have all the greater reason

679
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:27,833
to live well for them.

680
00:57:28,792 --> 00:57:30,042
I will never abandon anyone.

681
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:31,833
You wait for me.

682
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,374
Uncle

683
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:37,708
can't we go out?

684
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,792
But I had promised my father that

685
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:42,833
I would stay alive.

686
00:57:55,125 --> 00:57:56,667
Stay alive.

687
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:03,957
OK.

688
00:58:03,958 --> 00:58:06,166
I'll go through the
collapse area and join you.

689
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:08,207
We'll find you and help
you treat your wounds,

690
00:58:08,208 --> 00:58:10,167
and we'll take Zhuo Ya away with us.

691
00:58:53,083 --> 00:58:54,083
Zhuo Ya

692
00:58:54,292 --> 00:58:56,041
I'll get you out of here now

693
00:58:56,042 --> 00:58:57,042
okay?

694
01:00:00,542 --> 01:00:01,541
Stop,

695
01:00:01,542 --> 01:00:02,542
there's someone up ahead.

696
01:00:05,208 --> 01:00:06,208
Look around you,

697
01:00:06,667 --> 01:00:08,387
do you have any weapons to defend yourself?

698
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:17,375
What should we do now？

699
01:00:18,375 --> 01:00:20,124
It is your only way out,

700
01:00:20,125 --> 01:00:21,965
and you have to find a
way to get through here.

701
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:24,833
Take a look,

702
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:26,625
there's a button on the grip,

703
01:00:27,292 --> 01:00:28,207
press it,

704
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:29,528
and see whether there's a bullet.

705
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:33,333
Yes.

706
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,916
Then push up the grip,

707
01:00:34,917 --> 01:00:36,291
above the grip is the sleeve,

708
01:00:36,292 --> 01:00:37,292
and pull it.

709
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,249
Now this gun

710
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:43,708
is already in an excited state.

711
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:47,041
We don't have time to train aiming.

712
01:00:47,042 --> 01:00:47,957
Remember，

713
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:49,041
Don't panic!

714
01:00:49,042 --> 01:00:50,375
Grip the gun with your hands

715
01:00:50,917 --> 01:00:52,249
and lightly snap the trigger.

716
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,374
When you are shooting,

717
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,975
get as close to your target as possible.

718
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:57,403
But how do I approach the target?

719
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,500
Give me a second.

720
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:03,874
On that dead body just now,

721
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:05,395
there should be a night vision device.

722
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:11,874
You need to find this electric switch.

723
01:01:11,875 --> 01:01:14,041
I'll use the scout droid to distract them,

724
01:01:14,042 --> 01:01:15,457
and you pull down the switch.

725
01:01:15,458 --> 01:01:16,667
It's the only chance.

726
01:01:43,792 --> 01:01:44,749
Enron

727
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:45,750
are you okay?

728
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:49,249
Enron

729
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:50,250
what happened to you?

730
01:01:50,917 --> 01:01:52,167
Are you all right, sister?

731
01:01:55,792 --> 01:01:56,792
I'm OK.

732
01:01:57,458 --> 01:01:59,167
Enron, we really need to hurry.

733
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:01,707
Follow the red arrows

734
01:02:01,708 --> 01:02:02,708
on the manned display

735
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,207
we'll meet at the rendezvous point.

736
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:05,208
Okay.

737
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:24,999
Enron

738
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
where are you?

739
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:43,458
Enron

740
01:02:44,083 --> 01:02:45,083
Enron

741
01:03:30,792 --> 01:03:32,082
We just want to stay alive.

742
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:33,541
Why are you forcing us?

743
01:03:33,542 --> 01:03:35,262
That's not a reason
for you to kill someone.

744
01:04:03,542 --> 01:04:04,457
The things I want

745
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:06,416
are supposed to be ours,

746
01:04:06,417 --> 01:04:07,792
you have no right to judge me.

747
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:22,150
For the sake of the Kuroha Project,

748
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:24,667
we volunteered to be sacrificial victims.

749
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:26,916
And now I'm being like trash

750
01:04:26,917 --> 01:04:28,042
and kicked away by you guys.

751
01:04:28,708 --> 01:04:29,708
That's not true.

752
01:04:30,458 --> 01:04:31,833
The drug has been developed.

753
01:04:32,792 --> 01:04:34,312
It is in the blood of the little girl.

754
01:04:35,458 --> 01:04:36,458
Lie.

755
01:04:37,167 --> 01:04:38,833
You are the same as the Long Night Light,

756
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:41,208
full of lies.

757
01:05:01,458 --> 01:05:03,875
I just want to get back my belongings.

758
01:05:05,417 --> 01:05:06,417
You can't win.

759
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:21,208
Brother,

760
01:05:22,375 --> 01:05:23,792
I have saved you once again.

761
01:05:25,292 --> 01:05:26,292
Liu Huo

762
01:05:26,542 --> 01:05:27,542
you are still alive,

763
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,000
have you seen Enron?

764
01:05:37,958 --> 01:05:39,038
Liu Huo what are you doing?

765
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:47,250
What the hell are you doing?

766
01:05:48,042 --> 01:05:50,499
I'm carrying out the commands
of the Long Night Light.

767
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,625
What can the Long Night
Light really do for you?

768
01:05:56,208 --> 01:05:57,208
Brother,

769
01:05:58,333 --> 01:05:59,333
as you said,

770
01:06:00,750 --> 01:06:01,875
family is most important.

771
01:06:04,083 --> 01:06:05,083
You lost your family,

772
01:06:05,833 --> 01:06:07,125
but I still have.

773
01:06:08,542 --> 01:06:09,874
The only thing that can keep them alive

774
01:06:09,875 --> 01:06:11,250
is the light of the long night.

775
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:14,916
It lets me

776
01:06:14,917 --> 01:06:16,332
kill everyone here,

777
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:17,542
but I don't want to.

778
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:20,750
Well.

779
01:06:21,667 --> 01:06:22,907
Just hand over the little girl,

780
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:24,666
hand her over,

781
01:06:24,667 --> 01:06:25,958
then we can go back together.

782
01:06:28,375 --> 01:06:29,375
Liu Huo

783
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:31,167
I tell you,

784
01:06:31,958 --> 01:06:33,125
you were fooled by it.

785
01:06:34,167 --> 01:06:35,749
The Long Night Project
to the Kuroha Warriors

786
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:36,541
is all a conspiracy.

787
01:06:36,542 --> 01:06:38,022
All of them are trying to control us.

788
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:40,792
Now we have the drugs

789
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:43,833
to get back on the ground.

790
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:46,875
We have the best chance to change all this.

791
01:06:52,083 --> 01:06:53,083
Okay.

792
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,500
Since you are so stubborn,

793
01:06:57,958 --> 01:06:59,292
I will kill you first,

794
01:07:00,375 --> 01:07:01,375
and then,

795
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,417
I will go find the little girl by myself.

796
01:07:40,875 --> 01:07:41,499
Are you all right?

797
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:42,500
I'm fine

798
01:07:45,042 --> 01:07:46,875
Sister Enron

799
01:07:47,625 --> 01:07:48,749
Are you okay?

800
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:49,750
Don't worry.

801
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:30,292
Live on for us.
